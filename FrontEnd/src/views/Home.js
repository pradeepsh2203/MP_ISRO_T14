                Solar flares go through several stages, and there is no accurate
                way to forecast their strength or duration. Each of these stages
                might last anywhere from a few seconds and an hour. Here, we
                develop an automated flare detection algorithm that allows us to
                analyze the time series data of light curve.

                  A solar flare is a tremendous explosion on the Sun that
                  happens when energy stored in 'twisted' magnetic fields
                  (usually above sunspots) is suddenly released.

              A light curve is a graph that depicts an object's brightness over
              time. The light curve is a basic but important tool for scientists
              studying objects that alter their brightness over time, such as
              novae, supernovae, and variable stars. A light curve's record of
              variations can aid an astronomer in comprehending both the
              mechanisms at work and in identifying certain types of stellar
              occurrences.
